# Climate By Forest

This interactive graph shows modeled RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 data for forest ecoregions. This project is a fork of Climate By Location (a project for the NOAA Climate Program Office) for the US Forest Service.

## Methodology and sources
Forest climate data is selected by bounding box from the pre-gridded LOCA and Livneh datasets, then reduced to yearly or monthly values. For monthly/seasonal views the data is further reduced to show a given month across all years in the selected range of years.
 
* Downscaled modeled data: [LOCA](http://loca.ucsd.edu/).
* Historical observed data: [Livneh](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.livneh.metvars.html).
* Data services:  [Applied Climate Information System (ACIS)](http://www.rcc-acis.org/index.html).
